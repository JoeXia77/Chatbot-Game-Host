# Chatbot Game Host

This chatbot serves as a game host for Lateral-Thinking Puzzles, also known as Situation Puzzles or Minute Mysteries. It is powered by ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) and provides responses to your questions, though sometimes it might simply say "I don't know". The chatbot cannot create original stories for you to solve but can utilize any existing story and assist in hosting the game.

## How to Use

1. The API key is not provided, as it incurs a cost. You can obtain one from [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction).

2. Add your own to `chatbot.py` and Run `chatbot.py`.

3. The following libraries are commonly used, so you should not have any issues with the environment:

```python
import os
import json
import openai
import tkinter
```

4. A user interface will appear where you can type your question and press ENTER to send it to the chatbot. You will receive a Yes/No answer from the chatbot.
Sample

## Here's a sample interaction:

Story: A woman lives on the 30th floor and hates taking the stairs. Every day she takes the elevator down to the lobby floor to go to work. When she comes home from work, she takes the elevator to the 20th floor and walks the rest of the way up, except on days when it rains. Those days she takes the elevator all the way home.
Question: Why does she walk the last ten flights of stairs if she hates it so much?

No.

The woman is able to let the elevator go to 30th floor when raining, but in not raining days, she can't let the elevator directly go to 30th

Yes.

When raining days and not raining days, the elevator's function didn't changed but the change is more related to the woman

Yes.

could you give me some hint

Sure, here's a hint: The woman uses an object she carries with her on rainy days that helps her reach the 30th floor button in the elevator.

The button is 30th is pretty high, in raining days, she could use umbrella to reach the button but without it, she can only reach the 20th button. Is this correct?
Yes, that's correct! The woman is too petite to reach the button for the 30th floor. She can only reach the 20th floor button. On days when it rains, she uses her umbrella to hit the button for the 30th floor. Great job solving the puzzle!

## Updates:

image_to_json.py: 
This script uses OCR to read the text from images and saves it in JSON format. The JSON file can then be used as input for the translation script.

translation_gpt.py: 
This script takes the JSON file generated by image_to_json.py as input. It then uses the GPT-4 language model to translate the text from Chinese into the desired language. The translated text is then saved into a new JSON file.

chatbot.py: 
An updated version of the chatbot.py script now supports GPT-4 and has improved prompt messages for better interaction.
