    "appearance": "A woman lives on the 30th floor and hates taking the stairs. Every day she takes the elevator down to the lobby floor to go to work. When she comes home from work, she takes the elevator to the 20th floor and walks the rest of the way up, except on days when it rains. Those days she takes the elevator all the way home.",
    "question": "Why does she walk the last ten flights of stairs if she hates it so much?",
    "truth": "A petite woman lives in a high-rise building on the 30th floor. She dislikes taking the stairs and prefers to use the elevator whenever possible. The woman has difficulty reaching higher buttons in the elevator due to her short stature. There are no security restrictions, superstitions, or building policies that influence her actions. The elevator buttons are placed at a standard height, but still out of her reach. She doesn't have any friends or neighbors on the 20th floor, nor is there a gym, fitness center, or scenic spot that she likes to visit.Each day, she takes the elevator from her apartment on the 30th floor down to the lobby to go to work. The elevator is in good working condition and can reach all floors, including the 30th floor, without any issues.On non-rainy days, she takes the elevator up to the 20th floor and walks the remaining ten flights of stairs to her apartment. The reason behind her walking is not due to her wanting to exercise or because she is attracted to something on the floors between the 20th and 30th floor. In reality, the woman is too short to reach the button for the 30th floor inside the elevator. She can only reach the button for the 20th floor, so she is left with no other option but to walk the rest of the way.On rainy days, however, she has a workaround. She carries an umbrella with her, which she uses as an extended reach to press the button for the 30th floor. This allows her to avoid walking the stairs on those days.She usually returns home alone, but occasionally, someone might offer to help her press the button for the 30th floor, allowing her to ride the elevator all the way up without walking the stairs."
