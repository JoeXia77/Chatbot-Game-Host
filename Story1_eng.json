When asked why he can live so happily, OtakuAce's answer is punctuality. OtakuAce is very punctual, whether it's eating or sleeping, almost every day passes without a hitch. But one day, OtakuAce starved to death.",
    "truth": "Truth: OtakuAce is a mouse living in an old clock. When the clock moves, at every hour, a small door opens and a parrot comes out to announce the time. OtakuAce takes the opportunity to come out and search for food. Then, at the next hour, he returns to the clock through the small door. However, the elderly person living in the house was taken by their children to live in another city, and no one wound up the clock anymore. The clock stopped moving, and OtakuAce was trapped inside and eventually starved to death."
